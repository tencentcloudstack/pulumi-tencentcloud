/**
 * Provides a resource to create a teo teoDnsRecord
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as tencentcloud from "@tencentcloud_iac/pulumi";
 *
 * const teoDnsRecord = new tencentcloud.teo.DnsRecord("teo_dns_record", {
 *     zoneId: "zone-39quuimqg8r6",
 *     type: "A",
 *     content: "1.2.3.5",
 *     location: "Default",
 *     name: "a.makn.cn",
 *     priority: 5,
 *     ttl: 300,
 *     weight: -1,
 *     status: "enable",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * teo teo_dns_record can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import tencentcloud:Teo/dnsRecord:DnsRecord teo_dns_record {zoneId}#{recordId}
 * ```
