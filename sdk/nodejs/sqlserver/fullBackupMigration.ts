/**
 * Provides a resource to create a sqlserver fullBackupMigration
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as tencentcloud from "@pulumi/tencentcloud";
 *
 * const myMigration = new tencentcloud.Sqlserver.FullBackupMigration("my_migration", {
 *     backupFiles: [],
 *     instanceId: "mssql-qelbzgwf",
 *     migrationName: "migration_test",
 *     recoveryType: "FULL",
 *     uploadType: "COS_URL",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * sqlserver full_backup_migration can be imported using the id, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import tencentcloud:Sqlserver/fullBackupMigration:FullBackupMigration full_backup_migration full_backup_migration_id
 * ```
