/**
 * Provide a resource to create a payment SSL.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** Provides the creation of a paid certificate, including the submission of certificate information and order functions;
 * currently, it does not support re-issuing certificates, revoking certificates, and deleting certificates; the certificate remarks
 * and belonging items can be updated. The Destroy operation will only cancel the certificate order, and will not delete the
 * certificate and refund the fee. If you need a refund, you need to check the current certificate status in the console
 * as `Review Cancel`, and then you can click `Request a refund` to refund the fee. To update the information of a certificate,
 * we will automatically roll back your certificate if this certificate is already in the validation stage. This process may take
 * some time because the CA callback is time-consuming. Please be patient and follow the prompt message. Or, feel free to contact
 * Tencent Cloud Support.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as tencentcloud from "@tencentcloud_iac/pulumi";
 *
 * const example = new tencentcloud.ssl.PayCertificate("example", {
 *     productId: 33,
 *     domainNum: 1,
 *     alias: "ssl desc.",
 *     projectId: 0,
 *     information: {
 *         csrType: "online",
 *         certificateDomain: "www.example.com",
 *         organizationName: "Tencent",
 *         organizationDivision: "Qcloud",
 *         organizationAddress: "广东省深圳市南山区腾讯大厦1000号",
 *         organizationCountry: "CN",
 *         organizationCity: "深圳市",
 *         organizationRegion: "广东省",
 *         postalCode: "0755",
 *         phoneAreaCode: "0755",
 *         phoneNumber: "86013388",
 *         verifyType: "DNS",
 *         adminFirstName: "test",
 *         adminLastName: "test",
 *         adminPhoneNum: "12345678901",
 *         adminEmail: "test@tencent.com",
 *         adminPosition: "developer",
 *         contactFirstName: "test",
 *         contactLastName: "test",
 *         contactEmail: "test@tencent.com",
 *         contactNumber: "12345678901",
 *         contactPosition: "developer",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * payment SSL instance can be imported, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import tencentcloud:Ssl/payCertificate:PayCertificate ssl iPQNn61x#33#1#1
 * ```
