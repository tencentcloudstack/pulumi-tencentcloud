 * Provides a resource to restore object

 *
 * <!--Start PulumiCodeChooser -->
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as tencentcloud from "@tencentcloud_iac/pulumi";
 *
 * const objectRestore = new tencentcloud.cos.ObjectRestoreOperation("objectRestore", {
 *     bucket: "keep-test-1308919341",
 *     days: 2,
 *     key: "test-restore.txt",
 *     tier: "Expedited",
 * });
 * ```
 * <!--End PulumiCodeChooser -->
