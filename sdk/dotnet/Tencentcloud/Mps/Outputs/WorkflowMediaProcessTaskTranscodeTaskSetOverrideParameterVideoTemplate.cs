The width and height of the VideoTemplate are the maximum resolutions among the multiple code streams, and the bit rates in the VideoTemplate are multiple code rates. The highest bit rate in the stream, the vcrf in VideoTemplate is the highest quality among multiple bit streams. When the resolution, bit rate and vcrf are not set, the highest resolution generated by the ContentAdaptStream parameter is the resolution of the video source, and the video quality is close to vmaf95.
